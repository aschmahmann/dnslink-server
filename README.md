# dnslink-server
A basic DNSLink server implementation

## Git Example

This is a demonstration of building a DNSLink server that can be configured and used in go-ipfs.
The current example maps some git URL like github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs@master to a DNSLink name.
This mapping is not currently a valid DNS name, but could be standardized and improved in the future.
